title: About Me
---

__tl;dr__ I do stuff on my :computer:.

* I am learning Software Engineering at [FPT University](//fpt.edu.vn).

* I founded my first tech company [Innoteq Vietnam](//innoteq.vn).

* I used to be a freelancer, working on UI/UX and branding stuff before mainstream coding.

* I use `JavaScript` for most of my [projects](#) and I'm a big fan of it. I have experience in *ReactJS*, *React Native*, *GraphQL*, *Gatsby*, *ElectronJS* and *NodeJS*.

* I love [music](https://open.spotify.com/user/bkdev98/playlist/1OHAwWGoVY49oXivzbJRkW?si=FoTi-PwfRZ-X3xfZFzso0Q).
