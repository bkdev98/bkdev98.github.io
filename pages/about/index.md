title: About Me
---

__tl;dr__ I do stuff on my :computer:.

* I am learning Software Engineering at [FPT University](//fpt.edu.vn).

* I founded my first tech company [Innoteq Vietnam](//innoteq.vn).

* I used to be a freelancer, working on UI/UX and branding stuff before mainstream coding.

* I use `JavaScript` for most of my [projects](../portfolio/) and I'm a big fan of it. I have experience in *ReactJS*, *React Native*, *GraphQL*, *Gatsby*, *ElectronJS* and *NodeJS*.

* I love [music](https://open.spotify.com/user/bkdev98/playlist/1OHAwWGoVY49oXivzbJRkW?si=FoTi-PwfRZ-X3xfZFzso0Q).

## About Khanh Quoc Press {style=padding-bottom:0.37em;}

This site is primarily a place for keeping all my stuff, where I write down things happen around my head. On occasional bad days I might throw all my ramblings here too, but hopefully those will be rare.

This is also my experiment in using modern front-end tooling for blogging. I was using Blogger and Wordpress for sometime before switching to Ghost. For Khanh Quoc Press however, I am using a completely custom solution built with React, Webpack, Gatsby, PostCSS and NodeJS. The complete source code is [available](//github.com/bkdev98/bkdev98.github.io) from GitHub.
