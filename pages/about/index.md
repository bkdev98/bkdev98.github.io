## About Yuppies {style=padding-bottom:0.37em;}

This site is primarily an experiment in using modern front-end tooling for blogging. Its [predecessor](//isiddharth.com) has been on the internet since 2013 and is still on a 'free-to-host' provider. I was using Blogger for sometime before switching to Tumblr. For Yuppies however, I am using a completely custom solution built with React, Webpack, Gatsby, PostCSS, Firebase and Google Apps Script. The complete source code is [available](//github.com/f0rr0/f0rr0.github.io) from GitHub. People from the community had nice things to say about Yuppies:
